# My Saxophone Notes Project

The goal of this project is to increase my mastery of the whole topic of "Saxophones".

[Charlie Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Parker)  was THE absolute master of playing the saxophone,
but [Earl Bostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Bostic) was THE absolute master of ALL aspects of the saxophone. 

Like **Earl Bostic**, I want to become a master of ALL aspects of the saxophone:
- it's history
- technical details about the saxophone
- the future of the saxophone
- highly advanced techniques of saxophone playing

Every day, I will add a little bit of saxophone knowledge to my toolbox,
inpired by [Destin Sandlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destin_Sandlin) from [Smarter Every Day](https://www.youtube.com/user/destinws2).

I created the notes in this project using the [Zim Desktop Wiki](https://zim-wiki.org/).

**Please enjoy this project!!!!**
